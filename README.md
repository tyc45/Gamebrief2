# Brief_Game
## Context

This game is an achieved project by three students of Simplon Lille ( France.) We are students of the 2nd session of IA technicians. We started learning  Python. This project is about python basics ( particulary functions and tests.)

## The game

You are a adventurer and you are fighting against a little and ugly goblin. You and the goblin have both 50 life points.

On your turn you can choose between attacking the goblin or you can drink a heal potion who restore between 15 and 50 life points to your character. The attack can afflict 5 to 10 damage points to the goblin. Warning! you just have only three heal potions, use them wisely in your journey.
After, it's the goblin's turn. He attacks you and you loose between 5 and 15 life points.

The party is over when you or the goblin run out of life points.

## Configuration 

This is a game for your terminal. It's based on the version python 3.8 (Python 3.8.8 64-bit ('base':conda)).

Testing by pytest and we use the random library.
